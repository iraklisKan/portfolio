# Portfolio Project Image Setup

## Image File Needed:
Save the briefcase/portfolio image as `portfolio-briefcase.png` in the `images/` folder.

The image should be:
- **Format**: PNG (for transparency)
- **Size**: Ideally 256x256px or similar square aspect ratio
- **Path**: `c:\portfolio\images\portfolio-briefcase.png`

## What's Already Done:
✅ Created the images directory
✅ Updated HTML to use the image element
✅ Added CSS styling for proper display
✅ Added hover effects and animations

## Current Status:
The code is ready to display your briefcase image once you save it to the correct location.

## Fallback:
If the image doesn't load, you can temporarily use an emoji or icon until the image is properly placed.
